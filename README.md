### Project Aims

Our project has several key objectives. Firstly, we aim to utilize N-body techniques to develop an interactive model of the left atrium. This model will allow users to manipulate various parameters in real-time, facilitating the induction and observation of common arrhythmias.

Secondly, we seek to create a training and study tool for electrophysiologists, researchers, and medical students. Through accurately simulating left atrial arrhythmias and their treatment using simulated ablations, the model will serve as a valuable educational resource, enhancing understanding and skill development in this critical medical field.

Additionally, the project aims to advance research in electrophysiology by providing a platform for exploring novel treatment strategies and studying arrhythmia mechanisms. This could lead to new insights and innovations in the field, ultimately benefiting patients with cardiac arrhythmias.

In summary, the project's objectives include developing a cutting-edge model for arrhythmia simulation, providing an advanced training tool for medical professionals, and advancing research in electrophysiology.

## Background
Heart disease and strokes are the leading causes of death worldwide [1,2].
Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) is a significant contributing factor to strokes, heart
failure, and, in some cases, acute myocardial infarction [3-5]. Therefore, it is imperative
that, in our pursuit of building healthier lives free of cardiovascular diseases and strokes,
we focus on reducing the occurrence of SVT.
SVT encompasses all cardiac arrhythmias in which the underlying mechanism
sustaining the abnormal heartbeat originates above the ventricles. This abnormal
heartbeat can disrupt the natural synchronization between the atria and the ventricles,
disturbing the laminar blood flow through the heart and causing it to stagnate in the small
finger-like appendage of the left atrium (LA). Consequently, this allows for the formation
of certain types of lethal blood clots known as mural thrombi, which can become dislodged
and travel to the brain or coronary arteries, resulting in a stroke or heart attack [6]. It is
this mechanism that leads individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) to experience a five-fold
increased risk of stroke [7].
In a normally functioning heart, the sinus node serves as the pacemaker, consistently
producing an electrical impulse to dictate the heartâ€™s rhythm and rate. This electrical

impulse initiates a chain reaction that propagates throughout the heart, generating a life-
sustaining heartbeat. Ectopic electrical impulses can lead to chain reactions occurring at

the wrong place and time, disrupting the normal sinus rhythm. This disruption may cause
the atria to flutter, beat out of sync with the ventricles, or present a myriad of other
undesirable outcomes [8].

In many cases, SVT can be successfully controlled with medication and lifestyle
changes. However, some of these drugs are challenging for patients to tolerate, and
certain medications with the most established efficacy are known to be hepatotoxic,
causing deleterious side effects [9]. Hence, catheter ablation, though more invasive than
medication therapy, has proven to be the most reliably efficacious and safest method
physicians have for treating patients with recurring SVT [10-13].
Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation and three-dimensional electro-anatomical
mapping techniques have seen dramatic improvement over the last 10 years, enabling
doctors to perform procedures on beating hearts that were, until recently, thought
impossible [14,15]. However, much is still not understood about what causes heart
arrhythmias and how to use RF catheter ablation to treat them [16]. What would assist
doctors, researchers, and medical students is a way to rapidly and inexpensively test out
ideas and observe outcomes. We have created an N-body computer model of the LA to
do just this.
The LA was chosen because it is the site where most complex arrhythmias arise [17-
20]. The model captures both electrical and mechanical activity. Users can adjust the
model down to the individual muscle level and introduce ectopic events. Note: In this text
when we refer to a muscle, we mean a group of cardiomyocytes. These tools can be used
to induce arrhythmias in the LA that can be eliminated through simulated ablations. All of
these actions can be performed interactively in a running simulation, enabling users to
set up conditions in the simulated LA, test ablation strategies, and observe the outcomes.

    ./run
  
## Setup File 

### Units of Measurement
   	Length is in millimeters (mm)
   	Time is in milliseconds (ms)
   	Mass is in grams (g)
   
### New Run or Previous Run
   	You can start a new run using the nodes and muscles files, or you can continue a previous run.
   	NodesMusclesFileOrPreviousRunsFile = 0, run from the selected nodes and muscles file
   	NodesMusclesFileOrPreviousRunsFile = 1, run from a previous run file
   
   	If you selected 0, then you must set 
   	InputFileName = ***;
   	to the name of the nodes and muscles file you want to run from the list below. 
   	{Line11, Circle24, CSphere340, CSphere5680, IdealLeftAtrium13.0KNotTriangle, LeftAtriumRealRemovedAppendage}
   
   	If you selected 1, then you must set 
   	PreviousRunFileName = ***;
   	to the name of a previous run file you saved in the PreviousRunsFile folder. The three previous run files listed below
   	are alredy placed in this folder to use as demos. 
   	{PVFlutterDemo, MicroReentryDemo, RoofFlutterDemo}
   
### Nodes and Muscle View Size, and colors
   	You can set the size of the nodes and muscles with the
   	LineWidth = ***;
   	NodeRadiusAdjustment = ***;
   
   	Colors to help distinguish between simulation events can all be customized at the end of the setup file. 
   
   	Note: This only affects the viewing of the simulation; no actual functionality is changed with these parameters.

### Simulation Constants

   	Myocyte Force Per Mass strength = 596.0 mm/ms^2
   	BloodPressure = 80.0; millimeters of merculry converted to g/(mm*ms*ms) in the program.
   	MassOfAtria = 25; g
   	RadiusOfAtria = 17.8; mm
   	BaseMuscleRelaxedStrength = 2.0; This is just a force that helps the model keep its shape.
   	BaseMuscleCompresionStopFraction = 0.7 This only lets a muscle fiber reduce its length by 30%
   	BeatPeriod = 1000.0; (ms)
   	MaxNumberOfperiodicEctopicEvents = 50; This just sets an upper limit to the number ectopic beats a simulation can have.
   	Note: ectopic beats are extra pulse node that the user sets in an active simulation. Ectopic triggers are single events
   	stimulated by mouse clicks.
   
   	The above are typical values and are all changable in the setup file. These values are read in at the start of a simulation. 
   	They are not changable once the simulation starts.
